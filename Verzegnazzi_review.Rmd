### Dear Jose,
Thank you for sharing your R codes.  
It's clearly that you are very familiar with R tools, and had a great understanding of the steps, for genotypic data analyzing, covered in class. 
Your codes also run smoothly and perfectly in my computer.   
The markdown file is well organized, and each step is well explained, making it clearly and useful for future use of the code.
Unfortunately, I do not have additional suggestion for your work.
Thanks,
Anderson
